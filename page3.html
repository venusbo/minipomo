        <h2>what is minipomo?</h2>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique was developed in the late 1980s by then university student Francesco Cirillo. <br>
            Cirillo was struggling to focus on his studies and complete assignments. Feeling overwhelmed, he asked <br>
            himself to commit to just 10 minutes of focused study time. Encouraged by the challenge, <br>
            he found a tomato (pomodoro in Italian) shaped kitchen timer, and the Pomodoro technique was born.</p>
